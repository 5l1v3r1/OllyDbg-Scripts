OllyDbg is a classic debegger that I'll always have nostalgia for. There are a numbber of reasons why, the community being the highest. Over the years, scripts for unpacking, cracking, and mapping have been developed for most of the packers-including commercial. 

This repository contains a number of useful scripts that I've collected over the years.

### Repository Structure

Each folder is a type of packer. Within each folder, you'll find curated unpacking scripts for it.
